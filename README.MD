# Driver Easy 5.7.0 Pro Portable

DriverEasy Pro Activated and Portablized.

## Description

DriverEasy is a powerful software tool designed to automatically detect, download, and fix driver issues on your computer. With its user-friendly interface and comprehensive database, DriverEasy makes it easy to keep your drivers up-to-date, ensuring optimal performance for your hardware components.

## Not Features && Future Project
- When running a borrowed copy of pro, Easeware will throttle the download speed from their servers.
- I wrote a patch of sorts a while back, but seem to have lost the code.
	Easeware.Driver.Core.dll has a function that handles the encrypt/decrypt of the URLs needed to download drivers.
	Once the URL is decrypted, it is possible just to wget/etc the file and download unthrottled.
	The script I lost would work by letting the Driver Easy program do the intial scan. Then capture and decrypt the download links and save them in an output.txt
	The txt file can then be parsed and use something like wget to grab all the drivers. 
	
	- Check DriverEasy-EncryptFunction.txt for the code. Is .NET to make it easy as well.
